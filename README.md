# CITS3001-Project
The goal of this project is to develop a server application to manage the data and permit queries about Transperth bus and train routes. By successfully completing the project, you will have a greater understanding of the standard TCP and UDP protocols running over IP, communication between web-browsers and application programs using HTTP and HTML, and will have developed a simple text-based protocol to make and reply to queries for distributed information.
